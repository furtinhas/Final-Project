# README

This repository contains a start to finish machine learning project done as a final project for a previous AI training course. All steps, training decisions as well as data treatment, normalization and all other forms of data manipulation done to create the datasets used in training are elucidated in the jupyter notebook in the "project-notebook" folder. The aim of this repository is to try to improve upon that project.
